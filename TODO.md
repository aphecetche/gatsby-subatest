- replace MDX links by SuperLinks (see https://zslabs.com/articles/mdx-link-routing-in-gatsby or by material-ui links simply ?

- rename posts.jsx to something like teamPage.jsx (and put it into it's own theme ?)

- extract search functionality into an external theme

- make an overflow menu, or a toggle (see https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#behavior) to switch between light and dark modes

- package the material-ui stuff into a gatsby theme
