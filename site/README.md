# Status of the site

All is still basically "Work In Progress" ;-)

Only the the main content (articles) have been transfered (automatically, so do please do not edit them yet) from Joomla (from HTML to Markdown, using [aphecetche/joomla2markdown](https://github.com/aphecetche/joomla2markdown), using a dev site in [containers](https://github.com/aphecetche/docker-subaweb)).

# TODO

- [ ] replace MDX links by SuperLinks (see https://zslabs.com/articles/mdx-link-routing-in-gatsby or by material-ui links simply ?
- [ ] extract search functionality into an external theme
- [ ] connect the search theme (i.e. add a component to launch search and one for presenting results)
- [ ] make an overflow menu, or a toggle (see https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#behavior) to switch between light and dark modes
- [X] package the material-ui stuff into a gatsby theme
- [X] add the right side menus in the team pages
- [ ] add seminars
- [ ] add job offers
- [ ] add events
- [ ] bring some images to see how to properly deal with them ...
