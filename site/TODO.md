# TODO

## To reach same state as current site

- [ ] replace MDX links by SuperLinks (see https://zslabs.com/articles/mdx-link-routing-in-gatsby or by material-ui links simply ?
- [X] package the material-ui stuff into a gatsby theme
- [X] add the right side menus in the team pages
- [ ] add seminars
- [ ] add job offers
- [ ] add events
- [ ] bring some images to see how to properly deal with them ...
- [ ] add transition to bigmenu
- [ ] rename recherche.jsx to something like with-right-side-menu or sth alike
- [ ] electronique presentation : add the image gallery, fix the logo size, add links to experiments ?
- [ ] revamp the general/Logo.js component to handle _all_ logos (i.e. query all /logo/ images and have the logo regex, size and file type as a parameter to the Logo component)
- [ ] multilanguage support (english)

## To go beyond current site

- [ ] RightMenu => floating menu (follow scroll)
- [X] make an overflow menu, or a toggle (see https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#behavior) to switch between light and dark modes
- [ ] extract search functionality into an external theme
- [ ] connect the search theme (i.e. add a component to launch search and one for presenting results)
- [ ] restyle the administration/presentation page to make it a bit less boring (e.g. using icons per job type ?)
