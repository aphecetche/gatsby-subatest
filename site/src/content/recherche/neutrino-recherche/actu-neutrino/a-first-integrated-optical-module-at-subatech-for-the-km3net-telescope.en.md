The KM3NeT team of the Neutrino group has joined the collaboration in February 2017 and proposed to participate to the instrument construction by taking in charge a part of the integration of the optical modules. These modules are instrumented spheres (50 cm in diameter) equipped with 31 photo-multipliers and the control and acquisition systems.Â  They are themselves integrated in groups of 18 to form detection units. The 30 detection units of the Phase 1 of the project are currently in construction and deployment. Ultimately, 115 and 330 detection units will make respectively the ORCA and ARCA detectors accounting for more than 6000 optical modules.

The optical module has been integrated at Subatech during the spring and should be in principle the first of a long series. The next important milestone is the integration in France of the optical modules needed for a full detection unit by the end of 2018.
