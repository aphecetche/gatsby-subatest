**PRISMA,** **P**hysics of **R**adiation **I**nteraction**S** with **M**atter and **A**pplications, group researches are developped in the interdisciplinary field around three main activities :

*   **Radio-isotopes production for medical applications** (imaging, radio-immunotherapy..) with high intensity and high energy ARRONAX cyclotron, a unique tool in France. SUBATECH laboratory contributed widely to the realisation of this instrument that delivered its first beam in March 2010. It is therefore a full thematic under significant development for the production of radionuclides, their use and study of new detection techniques. The purpose of ARRONAX is to provide at mid-term high intensity beams (protons, deuterons and alphas) for which the team has developped the appropriate equipments. These efforts have been successful with the production on the site of the 64Cu isotope. These activities go beyond the mere provision of service because they rely on a real upstream research on the production of innovative isotopes (transmitters α, β + and β-) for radiotherapy and medical imaging (PET camera). Optimal production of isotopes requires a good knowledge of the nuclear reactions involved (prediction code of reaction cross sections, TALYS) and a validation of the production cross sections (Nuclear data banks are not always reliable for the nucleus of interest). The Monte Carlo simulation codes (MCNPX and GEANT IV) are used to estimate the inventory of isotopes produced and dose rates expected before extraction and chemical separation.

*   **Material non destructive analyses**. This activity is also booming. It is one of the components of well-structured materials pole at the region of Pays de Loire. This is particularly true for the platform TECNOCAMPUS EMC2 which includes all stakeholders (academic and industrial) of the composite industry. The PRISMA group actively participates in bringing its own expertise from nuclear analytical techniques such as implantation of PIXE (Proton Induced X-ray Emission) and PIGE (Particle Induced Gamma Emission) methods to the ARRONAX platform or developing an innovative technique coupling laser and ultrasonic techniques for the characterization of large composite materials. This activity is integrated at the regional level. It commits the PRISMA group in a high-level technological research that is based on a real SUBATECH expertise in the field of nuclear physics major instruments (ARRONAX, GANIL) and particle physics (ALICE).

*   **Sensors developpement for robotics**. This activity is performed in partnership with l'Institut de Recherche en Communication et Cybernétique de Nantes (IRCCYN) holder of an ANR project in robotics. The project deals with electrolocalisation of subaquatic objects for detection and recognition. The PRISMA group has developped the sensor and demonstration stand of the prototype, the sensor modeling has been done by a SUBATECH laboratory theorist. This activity is recognized as an exemplary synergy between high level fundamental and technological research.
