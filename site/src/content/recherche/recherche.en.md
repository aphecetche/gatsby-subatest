The core research activities at SUBATECH revolve around nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, in their fundamental and applied aspects, as well as their experimental and theoretical incarnations.

*   Radiochemistry
    *   Radioactivity and trace elements metrology and analysis service[(SMART)](../../SMART/web/en_index.html)
*   Physics
    *   The [quark gluon plasma](/), a state of matter that prevaled during the first microseconds after the big bang, is studied through high energy heavy ion collisions at [LHC](http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.html)with the [ALICE](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html) detector,
    *   Ultra high energy cosmic rays are revealed using [radio detection](/),
    *   [Nuclear waste management and nuclear reactor monitoring](/) techniques are developped,
    *   [Radio-isotopes production for medical applications, Material non destructive analyses, Sensors developpement for robotics,](/)
    *   [Liquid Xenon technology is used for medical imaging](/recherche/xenon/presentation-of-the-xenon-group.en) as well as [for dark matter quest](/recherche/xenon/presentation-of-the-xenon-group.en)
