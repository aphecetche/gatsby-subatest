The activities of the Experimental Research on Data Reactors and Energy (ERDRE) group are interdisciplinary. The areas concerned are nuclear energy and nuclear experimental physics with three main components.

One of these subjects concerns the electronuclear cycle back-end and management of high activity and long life nuclear waste. Among these nuclear waste, the minor actinides, even if produced in small quantities, are the most dangeruos waste on the long-term. Studies are carried out on the concept of accelerator driven reactor (ADS), future reactor and potential candidate for the transmutation of minor actinides. This topic has been studied for a dozen years through several projects. The experiment of irradiation of the MEGAPIE spallation target, designed by SUBATECH, was successfully conducted at PSI in 2006. Numerical simulation studies of the concept of hybrid reactor MYRRHA / XT-ADS have been performed. The EFIT, future European ADS industrial demonstrator is also studied in the context of nuclear power scenarios.Currently, our effort is concentrated on electronuclear scenario studies with a double-strates strategy on transmutation of minor actinides produced by the French nuclear power plants.The second part concerns the study of a new tool for monitoring nuclear reactors: the  antineutrinos, produced in quantity in beta decay of nuclear fission products. Antineutrinos can provide information on fission rate in the heart of a nuclear reactor without any intrusive check. This property may be interesting for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as antineutrinos may become a new tool in the fightagainst the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

The third aspect concerns research in fundamental physics which main subjects are neutrino physics and nuclear physics . In 2009 the group started a project to study the β- decay properties of fission products important for the simulation of the antineutrino spectrum emitted by the reactors (Double Chooz and Nucifer projects) and for the calculation of the residual power (nuclear reactor safety). The identified and measured nuclei presents also many interests in nuclear structure. There are close links between these activities.

The group is involved in many collaborations: Double Chooz is a fundamental neutrino physics experiment which aims to measure the last undetermined neutrino mixing angle θ13; the Nucifer and Solid experiments are dedicated to reactor antineutrino applied and fundamental physics; the JUNO experiment is dedicated to neutrino mass hierarchy measurement; and the TAS collaboration (Total Absorbtion Spectroscopy) that perfoms measurements of beta decay properties of fission products with a technique complementary to Germanium detector capable to correct the biais on beta decay data induced by the low detection efficiency of Ge.

In this context, we perform simulations of nuclear reactors, calculation of reactor antineutrino spectra from nuclear evaluated databases and our measured data and we study proliferation scenarios for PWR and CANDU reactors. Analysis of data of Double Chooz, Nucifer and SoLid experiments are also performed.

Finally the group participate to detector design in collaboration with the technical services: we have been responsible for the design, construction and integration of the detector and electronics of the cosmic muon veto of Nucifer and of the first modules of SoLid experiment.Currently the group has 6 permanent members, 2 postdoc, 3 PhD students.The two parts of the group are collaborating with the teams of IPN Orsay and LPSC Grenoble who develop the simulation code MCNP Utility for Reactor Evolution (MURE), available on the NEA website.The ERDRE group is co-financed by CNRS/IN2P3, SUBATECH, NEEDS, University of Nantes, EMN and CHANDA.
