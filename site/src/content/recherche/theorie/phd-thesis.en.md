Current PhD theses in the High-Energy Theory GroupBenjamin Guiot:  Study of hard probes interaction with the Quark-Gluon Plasma in a dynamical model Epos is an event generator for colliders and cosmic ray physics. The subject of the thesis is to implement heavy quarks in this code and to study energy loss in the QGP. PhD start:   November 1st, 2011Supervisors:   Klaus Werner, Marcus Bleicher

Benjamin Sintes:  Study of baryons in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model

We study the phase transition between hadronic matter and the quark-gluon plasma in the framework of the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model, where the lagrangian is based on the same symmetries as the lagrangian of QCD. Masses and cross sections have already been found for mesons and now we wish to study baryons at non-zero temperature and chemical potential.PhD start:  November 1st, 2011Supervisor:   Joerg Aichelin
