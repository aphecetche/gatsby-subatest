The theory group of Subatech consists of fifteen permanent members, working in various areas of research but finding a common denominator in the phenomenology of the strong interaction, described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). From the study of hard processes in elementary hadronic collisions to the global study of events in heavy-ion collisions, our main motivation is the search and characterization of the quark gluon plasma, which is also the main project of the [Plasma](fr/recherche/univers-a-haute-energie/plasma/presentation) experimental group in Subatech.Subatech is dominantly an experimental laboratory, thus an important dialogue between theory and experiment is looked for in our group, through the exploration of observed phenomena in partnership with various experimental collaborations, the development of simulation codes (such as BQMD, IQMD EPOS and CONEX used by many groups to analyze and interpret their data), but also through the proposal of experimental analyses to consider.In parallel, we participate to the development of new theoretical knowledge - often within the framework of phenomenological approaches - such as the relativistic Fokker-Planck equation or the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QCD. Our group also discusses some purely theoretical (eg., theories with higher-order derivatives) or applied (eg., electric sense of fishes) issues.
